# Python Practice


# 📘 Lesson 1.2: Python Basics

This lesson focuses on building a strong foundation in Python by understanding its core concepts and implementing them through **hands-on coding questions**.
All programs in this lesson are **written, executed, and tested in Python**.

## 🎯 Topics Covered
1. Syntax and Semantics  
2. Variables and Data Types  
3. Basic Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical)

---

##  What I Practiced
- Wrote basic Python statements following correct syntax
- Used variables with different data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
- Solved problems using arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
- Took user input and displayed output using Python code
